// 1. Dates aren't updating in our fancy new application.  Can you please fix it?
// 2. Our date display is pretty ugly; could you switch it so it looks like '6/15/22, 9:03 AM'?
// 3. We've just decided that we're going to have a lot more dates in our app and this is our one chance to decide on a strategy.  Are there any rules for handling dates you'd like to put in place?
